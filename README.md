Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.

Our penultimate project from the Le Wagon 9 week intensive bootcamp. 

Another clone of the Air B&B app, but with a costume rental theme. 

We took a tongue in cheek approach to this, using mid journey to create A.I. images of celebrities wearing all manner of fancy dress costumes, like Mike Tyson in a Ballerinas leotard 
and the rather fitting Boris Johnson as a clown.
